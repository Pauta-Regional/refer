"On a January evening of the early seventies, Christine Nilsson " & _

"Though there was already talk of the erection, in remote " & _
"metropolitan distances ""above the Forties,"" of a new Opera " & _
"House which should compete in costliness and splendour with " & _
"those of the great European capitals, the world of fashion was " & _
"still content to reassemble every winter in the shabby red and " & _
"gold boxes of the sociable old Academy. Conservatives " & _
"cherished it for being small and inconvenient, and thus keeping " & _
"out the ""new people"" whom New York was beginning to dread and " & _
"yet be drawn to and the sentimental clung to it for its historic " & _
"associations, and the musical for its excellent acoustics, " & _
"always so problematic a quality in halls built for the hearing " & _
"of music." & _
vbLf & _
vbTab & _
"It was Madame Nilsson's first appearance that winter, and what " & _
"the daily press had already learned to describe as ""an " & _
"exceptionally brilliant audience"" had gathered to hear her, " & _
"transported through the slippery, snowy streets in private " & _
"broughams, in the spacious family landau, or in the humbler but " & _
"more convenient ""Brown &c&o&u&p&" & Chr(233) & _
"."" To come to the Opera in a Brown &c&o&u&p&" & Chr(233) & _
" was almost as honourable a way of arriving as in one's own " & _
"carriage and departure by the same means had the immense " & _
"advantage of enabling one (with a playful allusion to democratic " & _
"principles) to scramble into the first Brown conveyance in the " & _
"line, instead of waiting till the cold-and-gin congested nose " & _
"of one's own coachman gleamed under the portico of the Academy. " & _
"It was one of the great livery-stableman's most masterly " & _
"intuitions to have discovered that Americans want to get away " & _
"from amusement even more quickly than they want to get to it." & _
vbLf & _
vbTab & _
"When Newland Archer opened the door at the back of the club box " & _
"the curtain had just gone up on the garden scene. There was no " & _
"reason why the young man should not have come earlier, for he " & _
"had dined at seven, alone with his mother and sister, and had " & _
"lingered afterward over a cigar in the Gothic library with " & _
"glazed black-walnut bookcases and finial-topped chairs which was " & _
"the only room in the house where Mrs. Archer allowed smoking. " & _
"But, in the first place, New York was a metropolis, and " & _
"perfectly aware that in metropolises it was ""not the thing"" to " & _
"arrive early at the opera and what was or was not ""the thing"" " & _
"played a part as important in Newland Archer's New York as the " & _
"inscrutable totem terrors that had ruled the destinies of his " & _
"forefathers thousands of years ago." & _
vbLf & _
vbTab & _
"The second reason for his delay was a personal one. He had " & _
"dawdled over his cigar because he was at heart a dilettante, and " & _
"thinking over a pleasure to come often gave him a subtler " & _
"satisfaction than its realisation. This was especially the case " & _
"when the pleasure was a delicate one, as his pleasures mostly " & _
"were; and on this occasion the moment he looked forward to was " & _
"so rare & exquisite in quality that" & ChrW(&H2014) & "well, if " & _
"he had timed his arrival in accord with the prima donna's " & _
"stage-manager he could not have entered the Academy at a more " & _
"significant moment than just as she was singing: ""He loves me" & _
ChrW(&H2014) & "he loves me not" & ChrW(&H2014) & "&h&e& " & _
