The Window Menu
</h2>

<p>
The <b>Window</b> menu has options that support the <a href="mdi.html">Multiple Document Interface</a> and let your work with multiple web pages.
</p>

<p>
The first four options arrange the child window in various ways:
</p>

<p>
<b>Cascade</b> shows them all the same size but staggered so you can see the title bars.
</p>

<p>
<b>Tile Horizontal</b> arranges all the windows horizontally across the workspace, perhaps in multiple rows.
</p>

<p>
<b>Tile Vertical</b> arranges all the windows vertically across the workspace, perhaps in multiple columns. 
</p>

<p>
If you've minimized any of the child windows, <b>Arrange Icons</b> arranges the icons on the bottom of the workspace.
</p>

<p>
The <b>Close All Windows</b> command closes all the child windows.
</p>

<p>
The remainder of the <b>Window</b> menu lists all the child windows. You can select any of the windows to bring it to the front.
