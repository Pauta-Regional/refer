The Multiple Document Interface (MDI)
</h2>

<p>
MDI Browser uses the Multiple Document Interface (MDI) to manage multiple web pages.
It helps to be familiar with certain aspects of MDI when using MDI Browser.
</p>

<p>
In MDI Browser, you can work with several web pages at the same time. Each web page appears in a separate child window. The title of the page and the URL is displayed in the child window caption bar. 
A new child window is created when you press the <b>Home</b> button, or select <b>New</b> or <b>Open</b> from the <a href="file.html">File Menu</a>, or type a new URL into the <a href="addrbar">Address Bar</a>.
</p>

<p>
You can bring a particular  child window to the front by clicking on it or by selecting it
from the <a href="window.html">Window Menu</a>. You can move or resize these window in the usual way. You can also use Ctrl-F6 to naviagate through the child windows.
</p>

<p>
If you minimize a child window, it will appear in a collapsed form at the bottom of the workspace. 
</p>

<p>
If you maximize a child window, it will fill up the workspace.  
In addition, the child window's system menu will appear at the left of the MDI Browser menu bar, and the minimize, maximize, and close boxes will appear at the far right of the menu bar. The web page title and URL then appears in the title bar of MDI Browser in square brackets.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="window.html">Window Menu</a> also contains options to cascade the child windows, to tile them horizontally or vertically, or to arrange the child window icons.
</p>

<p>
You can close any child window by clicking the close button or selecting <b>Close</b> from the system menu. You can close all the child windows by selecting <b>Close All Windows</b> from the <a href="window.html">Window Menu</a>.
