Program Overview
</h2>

<p>
MDI Browser is a web browser with an architecture based around the <a href="mdi.html">Multiple Document Interface (MDI)</a>. Each child window displays a different web page and can be independently navigated.
</p>

<p>
Aside from the use of MDI, the user interface of this program closely resembles that of Microsoft Internet Explorer. Indeed, this program uses the Internet Explorer "engine" in the form of a class named <i>System.Windows.Forms.WebBrowser</i> available in the .NET Framework 2.0.
</p>

<p>
This program was written by <a href="http://www.charlespetzold.com">Charles Petzold</a> for the book <i>Programming Microsoft Windows Forms</i> (Microsoft Press, 2005) in August 2005.
