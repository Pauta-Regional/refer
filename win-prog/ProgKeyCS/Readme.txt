WHAT'S IN THIS PACKAGE?
=======================
 
These companion media contain the source code for the sample programs 
presented in Programming in the Key of C#.



SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
===================
There are three ways in which you can compile the C# programs shown in the book
and your own C# programs:

  Visual C# .NET
    Microsoft Visual C# .NET is an integrated development environment that
    sells for about $100. 

    Alternatively, you can purchase Microsoft Visual Studio .NET
    (http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio), which also includes .NET versions
    of C++, J#, and Visual Basic, as well as other features. Various versions
    of Visual Studio .NET cost about $1,000 and up; upgrades to previous versions
    of Visual Studio cost about $500 and up. 

    To run Visual C# .NET, you need to be running Microsoft Windows 2000 or Windows XP.
    A 600-Mhz Pentium III is recommended with at least 160 megabytes of memory,
    2 gigabytes of free disk space (4.2 gigabytes for Visual Studio .NET), and
    a video display capable of a resolution at least 1024 by 768 with 256 colors.

  NOTE: Visual C# .NET and Visual Studio .NET store solution information in
  solution (.sln) files. These files are in Visual Studio .NET 2002 format.
  You can load these solutions into Visual Studio .NET 2003 and Visual C# .NET 2003.
  You'll see a warning that the project must be converted to Visual Studio .NET 2003
  format; click Yes to convert the project.


  The .NET Framework SDK
    It's also possible to use the book without Visual C# .NET or Visual Studio .NET.
    To do so, you need to download and install Microsoft .NET Framework Software 
    Development Kit (http://msdn.microsoft.com/downloads/list/netdevframework.asp).
    Either version 1.0 or 1.1 is fine. The .NET Framework SDK includes a command-line
    C# compiler that you can use in conjunction with a text editor such as the Windows
    Notepad. 

    You do not need to download the Microsoft .NET Framework SDK if you've installed
    Visual C# .NET or Visual Studio .NET. 


  Key of C#
    If you've installed the Microsoft .NET Framework SDK or Visual C# .NET,
    you can also install and run Charles Petzold's Key of C# program
    (http://www.charlespetzold.com/key/Setup Key of C#.exe), a Windows program for
    editing and compiling your C# programs.
